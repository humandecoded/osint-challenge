# Twayback: Downloading deleted Tweets from the Wayback Machine, made easy


#### Finding and downloading deleted Tweets takes a lot of time. Thankfully, with this tool, it becomes a piece of cake! ðŸŽ‚
### Twayback is a portmanteau of *Twitter* and the *Wayback Machine*. Enter your desired Twitter username, and let Twayback do the rest!

## Features
 - Can download some or all of a user's archived deleted Tweets.
 - Lets you extract Tweets text to a text file (yes, even quote retweets!)
 - Has ability to screenshot deleted Tweets.
 - Allows custom time range to narrow search for deleted Tweets archived between two dates.
 - Differentiates between accounts that are active, suspended, or don't/no longer exist.
 - Lets you know if a target handle's archived Tweets have been excluded from the Wayback Machine.
 - Saves a log of the deleted tweet URLs in case you want to view on the Wayback Machine.
 - Ability to rotate through a list of proxy servers to avoid 429 errors. **You will need to do this for data sets larger than 800 tweets.**

## Usage
>    twayback -u USERNAME [OPTIONS]
    
    -u, --username                                        Specify target user's Twitter handle

    --batch-size                                          Specify how many URLs you would like to 
                                                          examine at a time. Expecting an integer between
                                                          1 and 100. A larger number will give you a speed
                                                          boost but at the risk of errors. Default = 100

    --semaphore-size                                      Specify how many urls from --batch-size you would 
                                                          like to query asyncronously at once. Expecting an integer
                                                          between 1 and 50. A larger number will give you a speed
                                                          boost but at the risk of errors. Default = 50
    
    -from, --fromdate                                     Narrow search for deleted Tweets *archived*
                                                          on and after this date
                                                          (can be combined with -to)
                                                          (format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD
                                                          or YYYYMMDD, doesn't matter)
                                                          
                                            
    -to, --todate                                         Narrow search for deleted Tweets *archived*
                                                          on and before this date
                                                          (can be combined with -from)
                                                          (format YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY/MM/DD
                                                          or YYYYMMDD, doesn't matter)


    --proxy-file                                          Provide a list of proxies to use. You'll need this for checking large groups of tweets
                                                          Each line should contain one url:port to use
                                                          The script will pick a new proxy from the list at random after each --batch-size       

    
    Logs                                                  After checking a user's tweets but before you
                                                          make a download selection, a folder will be created
                                                          with that username. That folder will contain a log of:
                                                          <deleted-twitter-url>:<deleted-wayback-url> in case you needed them

## Screenshots

Screenshots are done using Playwright. To successfully take screenshots, please follow these steps:
 1. Open a terminal window.
 2. Run: `playwright install`.

## Troubleshooting
The default speed settings for `--semaphore-size` and `--batch-size` are set to the fastest possible execution. Reduce these numbers to slow down your execution and reduce the chance of errors. 
For checking large numbers of tweets (> than 800) you'll need to use web proxies and `--proxy-file` flag

## Things to keep in mind
 - Quality of the HTML files depends on how the Wayback Machine saved them. Some are better than others.
 - This tool is best for text. You might have some luck with photos. You cannot download videos.
 - By definition, if an account is suspended or no longer exists, all their Tweets would be considered deleted.
 - Custom date range is not about when Tweets were made, but rather when they were _archived_. For example, a Tweet from 2011 may have been archived today.
